Preparing For a Release
-----------------------

#. Confirm that the release and the proposed version number have been approved.

   The release must have been approved.
   Refer to the ClusterHQ `Flocker Releases and Versioning <https://docs.google.com/a/clusterhq.com/document/d/1xYbcU6chShgQQtqjFPcU1rXzDbi6ZsIg1n0DZpw6FfQ>`_ policy document.

   The version number must adhere to :ref:`the Flocker version numbering policy <version-numbers>`.

#. Export the version number of the release being created as an environment variable for later use:

   .. code-block:: console

      export VERSION=0.1.2

#. Create an issue in JIRA:

   This should be an "Improvement" in the current sprint, with "Release Flocker $VERSION" as the title, and it should be assigned to yourself.
   The issue does not need a design, so move the issue to the "Coding" state.

#. Create a clean, local Flocker release branch with no modifications:

   .. code-block:: console

      git clone git@github.com:ClusterHQ/flocker.git "flocker-${VERSION}"
      cd flocker-${VERSION}
      git checkout -b release/flocker-${VERSION} origin/master
      git push --set-upstream origin release/flocker-${VERSION}

#. Back port features from master (optional)

   The release may require certain changes to be back ported from the master branch.
   See :ref:`back-porting-changes`\ .

#. Ensure the release notes in :file:`NEWS` are up-to-date:

   XXX: Process to be decided.
   See https://clusterhq.atlassian.net/browse/FLOC-523

   - The NEWS date format is YYYY-MM-DD.
   - The NEWS file should also be updated for each pre-release and Weekly Development Release, however there should be only one NEWS entry for each Major Marketing Release and Minor Marketing Release.
   - This means that in doing a release, you may have to change the NEWS heading from a previous Weekly Development Release or pre-release.

   .. note:: ``git log`` can be used to see all merges between two versions.

             .. code-block:: console

                # Choose the tag of the last version with a "What's New" entry to compare the latest version to.
                $ export OLD_VERSION=0.3.0
                $ git log --first-parent ${OLD_VERSION}..release/flocker-${VERSION}

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git commit -am "Updated NEWS"

#. Ensure the notes in `docs/advanced/whatsnew.rst <https://github.com/ClusterHQ/flocker/blob/master/docs/advanced/whatsnew.rst>`_ are up-to-date:

   - Update the "What's New" document.
   - (optional) Add a version heading.
     If this is a Major or Minor Marketing (pre-)release, the "What's New" document should have a heading corresponding to the release version.
     If this is a weekly development release, add a "Next Release" heading instead.
   - Refer to the appropriate internal release planning document for a list of features that were scheduled for this release, e.g. Product Development > Releases > Release 0.3.1, and add bullet points for those features that have been completed.
   - Add bullet points for any other *important* new features and improvements from the NEWS file above,
   - and add links (where appropriate) to documentation that has been added for those features.

   Finally, commit the changes:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git commit -am "Updated What's New"

#. Ensure copyright dates in :file:`LICENSE` are up-to-date:

   - The list of years near the end of :file:`LICENSE` should include each year in which commits were made to the project.
   - This is already the case up to and including 2015.
   - If any such years are not present in the list, add them and commit the changes:

   .. code-block:: console

      git commit -am "Updated copyright"

#. Push the changes:

   .. code-block:: console

      git push

#. Ensure all the tests pass on BuildBot:

   Go to the `BuildBot web status`_ and force a build on the just-created branch.

   In addition, review the link-check step of the documentation builder to ensure that all the errors (the links with "[broken]") are expected.

#. Update the staging documentation.
   (For a documentation release ``${VERSION}`` should be the base release version in this step).

   .. TODO: The following steps should be automated

   #. Copy release documentation from ``clusterhq-dev-docs`` to ``clusterhq-staging-docs``.

      .. prompt:: bash $

         gsutil -m rsync -d -r s3://clusterhq-dev-docs/$(python setup.py --version)/ s3://clusterhq-staging-docs/en/${VERSION}/

   #. Update redirects to point to new documentation.

      .. warning:: Skip this step for weekly releases and pre-releases.

      .. prompt:: bash $

         gsutil -h x-amz-website-redirect-location:/en/${VERSION} setmeta s3://clusterhq-staging-docs/en/index.html
         gsutil -h x-amz-website-redirect-location:/en/${VERSION} setmeta s3://clusterhq-staging-docs/index.html

   #. Update the redirect rules in `S3`_ to point to the new release.

      In the properties of the ``clusterhq-staging-docs`` bucket under static website hosting,
      update the redirect for ``en/latest`` (for a marketing release) or ``en/devel`` to point at the new release.
      Update the ``RoutingRule`` block matching the appropriate key prefix, leaving other ``RoutingRule``\ s unchanged.

      .. code-block:: xml

         <RoutingRule>
           <Condition>
             <KeyPrefixEquals>en/latest/</KeyPrefixEquals>
           </Condition>
           <Redirect>
             <ReplaceKeyPrefixWith>en/${VERSION}/</ReplaceKeyPrefixWith>
             <HttpRedirectCode>302</HttpRedirectCode>
           </Redirect>
         </RoutingRule>

   #. Create an invalidation for the following paths in `CloudFront`_, for the ``docs.staging.clusterhq.com`` distribution::

         /
         /index.html
         /en/
         /en/index.html
         /en/latest/*
         /en/devel/*

#. Make a pull request on GitHub

   The pull request should be for the release branch against ``master``, with a ``[FLOC-123]`` summary prefix, referring to the release issue that it resolves.

   Wait for an accepted code review before continuing.

   .. warning:: Add a note to the pull request description explaining that the branch should not be merged until the release process is complete.


.. _pre-tag-review:

Pre-tag Review Process
----------------------

A tag cannot be deleted once it has been pushed to GitHub (this is a policy and not a technical limitation).
So it is important to check that the code in the release branch is working before it is tagged.
This review step is to ensure that all acceptance tests pass on the release branch before it is tagged.

.. note::

   Make sure to follow the latest version of this documentation when reviewing a release.

.. warning:: This process requires ``Vagrant`` and should be performed on your own workstation;
            **not** on a :doc:`Flocker development machine <vagrant>`.

#. Export the version number of the release being reviewed as an environment variable for later use:

   .. code-block:: console

      export VERSION=0.1.2

#. Do the acceptance tests:

   - Add the tutorial vagrant box that BuildBot has created from the release branch.

     .. code-block:: console

        vagrant box add http://build.clusterhq.com/results/vagrant/release/flocker-${VERSION}/flocker-tutorial.json

     You should now see the ``flocker-tutorial`` box listed:

     .. code-block:: console
        :emphasize-lines: 4

        $ vagrant box list
        clusterhq/fedora20-updated (virtualbox, 2014.09.19)
        clusterhq/flocker-dev      (virtualbox, 0.2.1.263.g572d20f)
        clusterhq/flocker-tutorial (virtualbox, <RELEASE_BRANCH_VERSION>)

   - Clone Flocker on your local workstation and install all ``dev`` requirements:

     .. note:: The following instructions use `virtualenvwrapper`_ but you can use `virtualenv`_ directly if you prefer.

     .. code-block:: console

        git clone git@github.com:ClusterHQ/flocker.git "flocker-${VERSION}"
        cd "flocker-${VERSION}"
        git checkout "release/flocker-${VERSION}"
        mkvirtualenv "flocker-release-${VERSION}"
        pip install --editable .[dev]

   - Install `PhantomJS`_:

     On Linux you will need to ensure that that the ``phantomjs`` binary is on your ``PATH`` before running the acceptance tests below.

   - Add the Vagrant key to your agent:

     .. code-block:: console

        ssh-add ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key

   - Run the automated acceptance tests.

     They will start the appropriate VMs.
     Ensure that they all pass, with no skips:

     .. code-block:: console

        $ admin/run-acceptance-tests --distribution fedora-20

#. Check documentation.

   - The documentation should be available at https://docs.staging.clusterhq.com/en/${VERSION}/.

   - For a marketing release, the following URLs should redirect to the above URL.

     - https://docs.staging.clusterhq.com/
     - https://docs.staging.clusterhq.com/en/
     - https://docs.staging.clusterhq.com/en/latest/

     In addition, check that deep-links to `/en/latest/` work.
     https://docs.staging.clusterhq.com/en/latest/authors.html
     should redirect to
     ``https://docs.staging.clusterhq.com/en/${VERSION}/authors.html``

   - For a development release, the following redirects should work.

     - https://docs.staging.clusterhq.com/en/devel/ should redirect to ``https://docs.staging.clusterhq.com/en/${VERSION}/``
     - https://docs.staging.clusterhq.com/en/latest/authors.html should redirect to ``https://docs.staging.clusterhq.com/en/${VERSION}/authors.html``

#. Accept or reject the release issue depending on whether everything has worked.

   - If accepting the issue, comment that the release engineer can continue by following :ref:`the Release section <release>` (do not merge the pull request).

   - If rejecting the issue, any problems must be resolved before repeating the review process.

Release
-------

.. warning:: The following steps should be carried out on a :doc:`Flocker development machine <vagrant>`.
             Log into the machine using SSH agent forwarding so that you can push changes to GitHub using the keys from your workstation.

             .. code-block:: console

                vagrant ssh -- -A

#. Export the version number of the release being completed as an environment variable for later use:

   .. code-block:: console

      export VERSION=0.1.2

#. Create a clean, local copy of the Flocker and `homebrew-tap`_ release branches with no modifications:

   .. code-block:: console

      git clone git@github.com:ClusterHQ/flocker.git "flocker-${VERSION}"
      git clone git@github.com:ClusterHQ/homebrew-tap.git "homebrew-tap-${VERSION}"
      cd homebrew-tap-${VERSION}
      git checkout -b release/flocker-${VERSION} origin/master
      git push --set-upstream origin release/flocker-${VERSION}
      cd ../flocker-${VERSION}
      git checkout release/flocker-${VERSION}

#. Create and activate the Flocker release virtual environment:

   .. note:: The following instructions use `virtualenvwrapper`_ but you can use `virtualenv`_ directly if you prefer.

   .. code-block:: console

      mkvirtualenv flocker-release-${VERSION}
      pip install --editable .[release]

#. Tag the version being released:

   .. code-block:: console

      git tag --annotate "${VERSION}" "release/flocker-${VERSION}" -m "Tag version ${VERSION}"
      git push origin "${VERSION}"

#. Go to the `BuildBot web status`_ and force a build on the tag.

   Force a build on a tag by putting the tag name (e.g. ``0.2.0``) into the branch box (without any prefix).

   .. note:: We force a build on the tag as well as the branch because the RPMs built before pushing the tag won't have the right version.
             Also, the RPM upload script currently expects the RPMs to be built from the tag, rather than the branch.

   Wait for the build to complete successfully.

#. Build Python packages and upload them to ``archive.clusterhq.com``

   .. note:: Skip this step for a documentation release.

   .. code-block:: console

      python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
      gsutil cp -a public-read \
          "dist/Flocker-${VERSION}.tar.gz" \
          "dist/Flocker-${VERSION}-py2-none-any.whl" \
          gs://archive.clusterhq.com/downloads/flocker/

#. Build RPM packages and upload them to ``archive.clusterhq.com``

   .. note:: Skip this step for a documentation release.

   .. code-block:: console

      admin/upload-rpms "${VERSION}"

#. Build and upload the tutorial :ref:`Vagrant box <build-vagrant-box>`.

   .. note:: Skip this step for a documentation release.

   .. warning:: This step requires ``Vagrant`` and should be performed on your own workstation;
                **not** on a :doc:`Flocker development machine <vagrant>`.

#. Create a version specific ``Homebrew`` recipe for this release:

   .. note:: Skip this step for a documentation release.

   XXX This should be automated https://clusterhq.atlassian.net/browse/FLOC-1150

   - Create a recipe file and push it to the `homebrew-tap`_ repository:

     .. code-block:: console

        cd ../homebrew-tap-${VERSION}
        ../flocker-${VERSION}/admin/make-homebrew-recipe > flocker-${VERSION}.rb
        git add flocker-${VERSION}.rb
        git commit -m "New Homebrew recipe"
        git push

   - Test the new recipe on OS X with `Homebrew`_ installed:

     Try installing the new recipe directly from a GitHub link

     .. code-block:: console

        brew install --verbose --debug https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClusterHQ/homebrew-tap/release/flocker-${VERSION}/flocker-${VERSION}.rb
        brew test flocker-${VERSION}.rb

   - Make a pull request:

     Make a `homebrew-tap`_ pull request for the release branch against ``master``, with a ``[FLOC-123]`` summary prefix, referring to the release issue that it resolves.

     Include the ``brew install`` line from the previous step, so that the reviewer knows how to test the new recipe.

   - Do not continue until the pull request is merged.
     Otherwise the documentation will refer to an unavailable ``Homebrew`` recipe.

#. Update the documentation.
   (For a documentation release ``${VERSION}`` should be the base release version in this step).

   #. Copy release documentation from ``clusterhq-dev-docs`` to ``clusterhq-docs``.

      .. prompt:: bash $

         gsutil -m rsync -d -r s3://clusterhq-dev-docs/$(python setup.py --version)/ s3://clusterhq-staging-docs/en/${VERSION}/

   #. Update redirects to point to new documentation.

      .. warning:: Skip this step for weekly releases and pre-releases.

         The features and documentation in weekly releases and pre-releases may not be complete and may not have been tested.
         We want new users' first experience with Flocker to be as smooth as possible so we direct them to the tutorial for the last stable release.

      .. prompt:: bash $

         gsutil -h x-amz-website-redirect-location:/en/${VERSION} setmeta s3://clusterhq-docs/en/index.html
         gsutil -h x-amz-website-redirect-location:/en/${VERSION} setmeta s3://clusterhq-docs/index.html

   #. Update the redirect rules in `S3`_ to point to the new release.

      In the properties of the ``clusterhq-docs`` bucket under static website hosting,
      update the redirect for ``en/latest`` (for a marketing release) or ``en/devel`` to point at the new release.
      Update the ``RoutingRule`` block matching the appropriate key prefix, leaving other ``RoutingRule``\ s unchanged.

      .. code-block:: xml

         <RoutingRule>
           <Condition>
             <KeyPrefixEquals>en/latest/</KeyPrefixEquals>
           </Condition>
           <Redirect>
             <ReplaceKeyPrefixWith>en/${VERSION}/</ReplaceKeyPrefixWith>
             <HttpRedirectCode>302</HttpRedirectCode>
           </Redirect>
         </RoutingRule>

   #. Create an invalidation for the following paths in `CloudFront`_, for the ``docs.clusterhq.com`` distribution::

         /
         /index.html
         /en/
         /en/index.html
         /en/latest/*
         /en/devel/*

#. Submit the release pull request for review again.

Post-Release Review Process
---------------------------

#. Remove the Vagrant box which was added as part of :ref:`pre-tag-review`:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ vagrant box remove clusterhq/flocker-tutorial

#. Check that the documentation is set up correctly:

   - The documentation should be available at https://docs.clusterhq.com/en/${VERSION}/.

   - For a marketing release, the following URLs should redirect to the above URL.

     - https://docs.clusterhq.com/
     - https://docs.clusterhq.com/en/
     - https://docs.clusterhq.com/en/latest/

     In addition, check that deep-links to `/en/latest/` work.
     https://docs.clusterhq.com/en/latest/authors.html
     should redirect to
     ``https://docs.clusterhq.com/en/${VERSION}/authors.html``

   - For a development release, the following redirects should work.

     - https://docs.clusterhq.com/en/devel/ should redirect to ``https://docs.clusterhq.com/en/${VERSION}/``
     - https://docs.clusterhq.com/en/latest/authors.html should redirect to ``https://docs.clusterhq.com/en/${VERSION}/authors.html``

#. Verify that the tutorial works on all supported platforms:

   * The client (``flocker-deploy``) should be installed on all supported platforms.

     Follow the :ref:`Flocker client installation documentation<installing-flocker-cli>`.

     XXX: This step should be automated. See `FLOC-1039 <https://clusterhq.atlassian.net/browse/FLOC-1039>`_.

   * The node package (``flocker-node``) should be installed on all supported platforms.
     You can use vagrant to boot a clean Fedora 20 machine as follows:

     .. code-block:: console

        mkdir /tmp/fedora20
        cd /tmp/fedora20
        vagrant init clusterhq/fedora20-updated
        vagrant up
        vagrant ssh

     Follow the :ref:`Flocker node installation documentation<installing-flocker-node>`.

     XXX: These steps should be automated. See (
     `FLOC-965 <https://clusterhq.atlassian.net/browse/FLOC-965>`_,
     `FLOC-957 <https://clusterhq.atlassian.net/browse/FLOC-957>`_,
     `FLOC-958 <https://clusterhq.atlassian.net/browse/FLOC-958>`_
     ).

   * Follow the :doc:`../../indepth/tutorial/vagrant-setup` part of the tutorial to make sure that the Vagrant nodes start up correctly.
   * Follow the :doc:`ELK example documentation<../../indepth/examples/linking>` using a Linux client installation and Rackspace Fedora20 nodes.

#. Merge the release pull request.


Improving the Release Process
-----------------------------

The release engineer should aim to spend up to one day improving the release process in whichever way they find most appropriate.
If there is no existing issue for the planned improvements then a new one should be made.
Search for "labels = release_process AND status != done" to find existing issues relating to the release process.
The issue(s) for the planned improvements should be put into the next sprint.
